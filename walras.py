"""
 Supply functions are a way of representing agents like AMMs when what we
  want is to find the optimal price.

 Given a price vector, they describe the maximum trade they would clear 
 at that price.  
  "It takes positive values at coordinate `i`  when the agent is selling 
   the `i`-th asset and negative values when buying"
